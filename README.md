# Backbone

All of the videos below bulid off of [this repo #1](https://github.com/learn-co-students/fe-js-backbone-produce-store-bk-002). Before getting started, if you're feeling adventurous, clone down Repo #3, Repo #2 if you're feeling less so. Run the app to see what functionality we're going for. 

Then add code to the first repo to achieve the functionality seen in Repo #2/Repo #3. If you get stuck, watch a related video.

Alternatively, you could watch all the vidoes and code along as Jon Gover builds the app. Up to you!
