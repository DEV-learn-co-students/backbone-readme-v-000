# Backbone

Welcome to the world of Backbone, a front-end framework that _"gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface."_

All of the videos below build off this [Produce Store repo](https://learn.co/lessons/11414). Before getting started, if you're feeling adventurous, clone down Repo #2 and Repo #3 to see what functionality we'll be building.

Add code to the first repo to achieve the functionality seen in Repo #2 and Repo #3. If you get stuck, watch a related video. If you want a step-by-step guide through the process, watch all the vidoes in order and code along as Jon Gover builds the app. Up to you!
